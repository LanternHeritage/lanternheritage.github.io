Although Australia has a short documented history compared with other countries, there is an incredible diversity to the range of site types that it comprises. The problem for developers can be in understanding what sorts of sites have heritage significance and knowing when to call in a specialist.




Lantern Heritage has demonstrated experience across the heritage of early settlement/pastoral sites, mining sites, industrial landscapes, transport corridors, built landscape, ethnic diversity, and religious identity. Our Director is recognised by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage as a S140 Excavation Director.
