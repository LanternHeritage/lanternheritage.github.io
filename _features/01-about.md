Lantern Heritage is committed to tailoring a package to meet your needs. We have demonstrated experience in providing heritage advice, assessments and impact mitigation programs on major projects. That same level of expertise, and dedication to customer service, is also available to smaller developers, without the prohibitive costs often associated with specialists.


**Integrity, transparency, and cost effective delivery for the heritage component of your DA, EIS, REF or EA**

No matter where you are at in project planning or delivery, we can provide innovative and cost effective approaches to navigating your obligations with regard to heritage legislation.
